# odin-landing-page
TOP final project of CSS foundations

On this project I exercised all the tools around flex in CSS.
I didn't make the page pretty but i fell that i grasped the main concepts of flex.

Main difficulties that i have found were related to padding and spacing the content to look "nice" on the page.
